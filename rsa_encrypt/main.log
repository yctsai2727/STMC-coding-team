 Check the spelling, where the font is installed etc. etc.

 When in doubt, ask someone for help!

misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.

The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.

I can only go up to 2147483647='17777777777="7FFFFFFF,
so I'm using that number instead of yours.

I can't work with sizes bigger than about 19 feet.
Continue and I'll use the largest value I can.

l.21 
     
I can only handle fonts at positive sizes that are
less than 2048pt, so I've changed what you said to 10pt.

c:/Users/wincentsai/Documents/STMC coding team/STMC-coding-team/rsa_encrypt/beamerthemeUCBerkeley.sty:21: Font TU/OpenSans(0)/m/n/10="Open Sans" at 10.0pt not loadable: Metric (TFM) file or installed font not found.

l.21 
     
I wasn't able to read the size data for this font,
so I will ignore the font specification.
[Wizards can fix TFM files using TFtoPL/PLtoTF.]
You might try inserting a different font spec;
e.g., type `I\font<same font id>=<substitute font name>'.
