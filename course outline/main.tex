    \item Ability of read and write program in a structured way
    \item Problem Solving skills
    \item Mathematics skills
    \item \sout{Debug and suffer}
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What are expected from you?}
  \begin{block}{1. Practice and be patient}
    Work on exercise problems yourselves or with your friends and do coding hands-on; Coding can sometimes be frustrating, but don't give up too easily!

\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{What are expected from you?}
  \begin{block}{2. Speak out}
    Speak out if you don't understand or you got any ideas to share. There's no shame in asking questions. Discuss with others and share your ideas / difficultites! Also feel free to contact me if you have any thing related to programming that you want me to include in the lesson.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{What are expected from you?}
  \begin{block}{3. Explore}
    I will be teaching you for only 9 lessons, it is impossible to cover all the interesting material in the world of coding and programming, besides suggesting material for me to include in the lecture, you can (and also suggested to) explore yourself in the internet and try out different interesting projects.
