\frametitle{Explaining helloworld.py : Comments}
Another type of comments available in Python (and many other languages) is the \textbf{block comment}. They look something like this:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
  # This is the single line comment we just saw

  """
     This is a block comment,
     anything inside this block will be ignored
  """

  """ This is also a block comment """
\end{lstlisting}
