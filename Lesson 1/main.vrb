\frametitle{More experiments}
Let's try out something more:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Change the variable \texttt{name} to sth else, say your favorite character or song or etc, does the code still works?
    \item try to input something else when answering the question, like entering number, what you expect to get?
    \item can youy modify the code to ask more question? thens print out all the information you gather in one line.
  \end{itemize}
